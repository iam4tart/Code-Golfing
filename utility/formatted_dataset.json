The algorithm begins with an initial population of particles, each of which represents a possible solution to the optimization problem.

In each iteration, the PSO operator is used to update the particle velocities and positions, while the MOEA operator is used to update the particle fitness values.

The algorithm uses a moving average to generate buy and sell signals. The moving average is used to smooth out the noise in the data and to make it easier to identify trends. The algorithm will buy when the moving average goes up and sell when the moving average goes down.\n\nThe Simulated Trading algorithm is a simple algorithm that is easy to implement and understand"

The algorithm was first proposed by Xin-She Yang and Suash Deb in their paper \"Firefly Algorithms for Multimodal Optimization\" in 2009.\n\nThe basic idea behind the algorithm is to mimic the flashing behavior of fireflies in order to find the global optimum of a given function. In the natural world, fireflies use their light to attract mates. The brighter the light, the more attractive the firefly is to potential mates. In the Firefly Algorithm, the brightness of the fireflies is analogous to the fitness of the solutions in the search space. The brighter the firefly, the better the solution. The algorithm works by iteratively updating the brightness of the fireflies according to the following equation:\n\nI(t+1) = I(t) + \u03b2*exp(-\u03b3*r)*(cos(\u03b8)"
